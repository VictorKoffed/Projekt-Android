**Done âœ…**
- Fetch random coffee images via the **Coffee API** using **Volley** 
- Display images with **Coil** in Jetpack Compose 
- Connect to the **Bookoo smart scale** via Bluetooth for real-time weight data
- Store brew history locally with **Room (SQLite)**
- See weight and time in a chart of the brew from the **Bookoo smart scale** via Bluetooth for real-time brew data
- Add Flow to the chart graf
- Create a working Homescreen that follows the mockup **Homescreen**
- Create a working Graphscreen that follows the mockup **Graphscreen**
- Clean and responsive UI design inspired by modern coffee apps
- Capture and save photos of brews using **CameraX**

**Planned**

- All done....
